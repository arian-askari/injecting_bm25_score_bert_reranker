# Injecting the BM25 Score as Text Into BERT-Based Re-rankers
Arian Askari, Amin Abolghasemi, Gabriella Pasi, Wessel Kraaij and Suzan Verberne. *Injecting the BM25 Score as Text Improves BERT-Based Re-rankers*. ECIR 2023 (full paper).

Please check out my recent github repository on a follow-up work on this idea, in that you could see example of injecting BM25 score for training BM25CAT models. Also, I provide BM25 scores in that repo: https://github.com/arian-askari/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v3/blob/main/train/train_ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12_v3_bm25.py

This repository will be completed later soon!
